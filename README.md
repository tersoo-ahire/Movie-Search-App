# Movie-Search-App

Movie Finder is a web application built using dotnet core and react to allow users to search movies via ombdp API's and return their search results. Users can view detailed information about the movie when they click on any result.

To launch the platform locally you will do the following;

1. Navigate to the root directory of the Dotnet Project named "MovieFinderApi" and run this command in your terminal `dotnet build`
2. After the project has successfully built, run this command in your terminal to start the server     `dotnet run`
3. If the previous command was successfull it will show that it is now listening to locahost.
4. Once that has been completed, navigate to the root directory of the react project named React_Frontend and start the server with the following command `npm run dev`
5. The previous command will start up the server for react on localhost. Click on the localhost link provided and it will open the web application in your browser.
